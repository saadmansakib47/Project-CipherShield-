# Project-CipherShield
## Introduction
Welcome to CipherShield, a security based console application developed in C# using Visual Studio. This application allows users to generate passwords according to their requirement, assess the strength of their password, encrypt and decrypt passwords/texts using different encryption algorithms and finally hash their passwords/texts using different hashing algorithms that have been implemented from scratch.

## Motivation Behind the Project
CipherShield was created out of our passion for CyberSecurity and Cryptogrphic functions. We wanted to learn about Password salting and implement various Encryption and Hashing algorithms from scratch following the OOP concepts and SOLID principles. This project can serve as an educational tool to help users understand password security best practices.
